						Rutgers Sakai Mobile and it's developers are very committed to keeping your
						information safe. Rutgers Sakai Mobile does make use of <a
						href="https://get.fabric.io">Fabric</a> to track feature usage and crash
						reporting using the <a href="https://answers.io">Answers</a> and <a
						href="https://try.crashlytics.com">Crashlytics</a> services. In order to learn
						more about what data Crashlytics and Answers are capable of collecting from you,
						please see both <a
						href="https://try.crashlytics.com/terms/privacy-policy.pdf">Crashlytics privacy
						policy</a> as well as <a
						href="https://answers.io/img/onepager/privacy.pdf">Answers' privacy policy</a>.
						From these services, Rutgers Sakai Mobile only collects anonymized device
						information and crash reports that do not disclose any other information about
						you. These help improve Rutgers Sakai Mobile and focus developer efforts on the
						areas that matter most. IP Address collection has also been disabled and is not
						collected by Rutgers Sakai Mobile.
						</p>
						<p>
						Rutgers Sakai Mobile uses cookies to manage a session with the Sakai servers
						managed by Rutgers. Since Sakai does not have a standard method of
						authenticating third-party services like Rutgers Sakai Mobile, storing cookies
						are necessary in order for the app to function. Rutgers Sakai Mobile will never
						see your password and the app will never use your credentials
						directly as authentication is done through Rutgers Central Authentication in a
						webview.
						</p>
						<p>
						If you are a student at Rutgers, while using this app you are also subject to
						Rutgers University <a
						href="http://academicintegrity.rutgers.edu/academic-integrity-at-rutgers/">academic
						integrity policy</a>, as well as any other rules and restrictions placed on
						Rutgers' Sakai LMS.
