                    Rutgers Sakai Mobile and it's developers are very committed to keeping your
                    information safe. Rutgers Sakai Mobile does make use of <a
                    href="https://get.fabric.io">Fabric</a> to track feature usage and crash
                    reporting using the <a href="https://answers.io">Answers</a> and <a
                    href="https://try.crashlytics.com">Crashlytics</a> services. In order to learn
                    more about what data Crashlytics and Answers are capable of collecting from you,
                    please see both <a
                    href="https://try.crashlytics.com/terms/privacy-policy.pdf">Crashlytics privacy
                    policy</a> as well as <a
                    href="https://answers.io/img/onepager/privacy.pdf">Answers' privacy policy</a>.
                    From these services, Rutgers Sakai Mobile only collects anonymized device
                    information and crash reports that do not disclose any other information about
                    you. These help improve Rutgers Sakai Mobile and focus developer efforts on the
                    areas that matter most. IP Address collection has also been disabled and is not
                    collected by Rutgers Sakai Mobile.

                    Rutgers Sakai Mobile uses cookies to manage a session with the Sakai servers
                    managed by Rutgers. Since Sakai does not have a standard method of
                    authenticating third-party services like Rutgers Sakai Mobile, storing cookies
                    are necessary in order for the app to function. Rutgers Sakai Mobile will never
                    see your password and the app will never use your credentials
                    directly as authentication is done through Rutgers Central Authentication in a
                    webview.
