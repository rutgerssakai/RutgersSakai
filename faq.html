                    How does Google Smart Lock work, and how is it used?
                </h6>
                <p class="mdc-typography--body1">
                    <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6197437" target="_blank">
                        <i>Smart Lock for Passwords</i>
                    </a> is a Google service that allows for login credentials to be synced to your Google
                    account. This uses the same mechanism by which Google Chrome saves your credentials
                    for your convenience. <br />
                    Since users found it annoying to manually log into Sakai every time their cookies
                    expired, we used Smart Lock to securely save your credentials to your Google account.
                    When the application is opened, we request the saved credentials and simply autofill
                    the login form for your convenience. This means that even if your Sakai session expires 
                    or you install Sakai Mobile on a new device, the application can automatically log you 
                    into your Sakai account. <br />
                    Note that the usage of Smart Lock means your credentials are not stored on-device
                    and instead use Google's secure encryption and cloud storage services.
                    The handling of credentials by Google services makes Smart Lock far more secure than
                    storing your credentials somewhere in your device and risking it being compromised
                    (especially since your NetID is tied to much more than just Sakai).

                <h6 class="mdc-typography--headline6 faq-question">
                    I accidentally clicked "Never" when prompted to save my password, how can I revert this?
                </h6>
                <p class="mdc-typography--body1">
                    If you would like to re-enable Smart Lock in Sakai Mobile to benefit from auto-login, follow
                    these steps:
                </p>
                <ol class="mdc-typography--body1">
                    <li>
                        In your Android device's <b><i>Settings</i></b> application, go to:
                        <i><b>Google > </b>scroll down to go to <b>Smart Lock for Passwords</b></i>   
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make sure "Sakai Mobile" is not in the <b><i>Never Save</i></b> list.
                        If you do see "Sakai Mobile" in that list, tap on it and select <b><i>Ok</i></b>
                        to remove it from that list.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you are logged into multiple Google accounts on your Android device, you might need
                        to repeat Step 2 for all of those accounts. You can see <b><i>Smart Lock for Passwords</i></b>
                        settings for other Google accounts by clicking on the top bar and switching between accounts.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Close and re-open the Sakai Mobile application. If you are still logged in, this is because
                        your Sakai cookies still represent an active session. In this case, press <b><i>Logout</i></b>
                        at the bottom of the app's Settings tab (the right-most tab).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Log in as usual inside the CAS Authentication WebView, and select <b><i>Save Password</i></b>
                        when prompted to do so by Smart Lock.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You are set for auto-login / credential persistence!
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    How do I remove my Sakai credentials from Smart Lock?

                <p class="mdc-typography--body1">
                    If you no longer want Sakai Mobile to use Smart Lock for keeping you logged in, follow these steps:

                <ol class="mdc-typography--body1">
                    <li>
                        Visit Google's 
                        <b><i><a href="https://passwords.google.com" target="_blank">Password Manager</a></i></b>
                        service.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In the top-right, select the Google account which you saved your Sakai Mobile credentials with.
                        If you're not sure which account you saved your credentials with, use the 
                        <b><i>Search passwords</i></b> input and enter a search criteria like "Sakai" to see if
                        the Sakai Mobile application shows up in the list.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Select the Sakai Mobile application. Google will prompt you to enter your Google account's
                        password for security purposes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        At the bottom right of the saved credential, select <b><i>Delete</i></b>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Close and re-open the Sakai Mobile application on your Android device. If you are still logged in, 
                        this is because your Sakai cookies still represent an active session. In this case, 
                        press <b><i>Logout</i></b> at the bottom of the app's Settings tab (the right-most tab).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When you visit the login screen, Smart Lock will not prompt you to select an account
                        because it was deleted. After logging in, you can select <b><i>Never</i></b> when prompted
                        to save credentials if you never want Sakai Mobile to save your credentials again.
